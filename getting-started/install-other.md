title: Installation on other Operating Systems

We do not provided support for operating systems different from Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora.

If you wish to try anyway, you will need to install at least GNU make, and a fairly recent C++ compiler supporting the C++17 standard.
Suitable compilers include:
* GNU C/C++ compiler (gcc) version 7 or newer,
* Clang C/C++ compiler version 5 or newer,
* Intel C/C++ Compiler (icc) version 19.0 or newer.

  <strong>WARNING:</strong>
  The installation process of OSCAR, particularly the precompilation step, requires <strong>at least 6GB of free memory</strong>. For optimal performance with OSCAR, we recommend having <strong>at least 16GB of free memory</strong>.
