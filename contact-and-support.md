We offer several ways to ask questions, discuss OSCAR, and report issues. Choose the method that works best for you.  

### Slack  

[Slack](https://slack.com) is a non-public chat platform where we discuss OSCAR, answer questions, and provide support. Whether you need help with installation, usage, or development, feel free to ask here.
