## Program
* Start: Monday, October 10, at 13:00
* Finish: Friday, October 14, at 13:00
* Where: Lecture Hall III, building E2 5 (unless noted otherwise)

This workshop aims at all levels of OSCAR users and developers.
For beginners, there is an introductory crash course at the start.
We also invited three experts to give accessible introduction to
various topics. We then will try together to implement what they covered
using OSCAR, during live hands-on session. 

**Please bring a laptop and [follow the preparation instructions](../prepare)**

Besides this, participants are also invited to work through Julia tutorials
or [Oscar exercises](https://oscar.computeralgebra.de/meetings/2021-09/exercises/),
or to bring their own problems (e.g. from their research) and will try to
provide support.


The program below may still be revised and we may even augment it during the
week. If you have suggestions or wishes, please contact [Claus Fieker](mailto:fieker@mathematik.uni-kl.de)
and [Max Horn](mailto:horn@mathematik.uni-kl.de).
