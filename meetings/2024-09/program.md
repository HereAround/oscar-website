## Ideas

Here are some ideas for topics we *could* tackle.
What we actually will do will depend on who participates.

- 1 day: performance optimization for Julia code
   - 1/2 day for beginners
   - 1/2 day for advanced users
   - "bring your own problem": ideally you have some code in mind you'd like to speed up
      (you'll need an example that runs under 15 minutes; faster is better)
- increase coverage
- complete PRs, merge them
- resolve issues in AA, Nemo, Oscar...
- G-modules: complete them
- group cohomology: which interfaces? application? -> application driven development
- orbit-stabilizer computations
- meataxe
- norm relations of non-normal fields
- canonical maps
- more serialization
- work on Singular / Algebraic Geometry: complete <https://hackmd.io/hYXl0YRTSDKhqzfVSMpqsQ>
