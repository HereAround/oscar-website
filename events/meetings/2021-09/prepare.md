Before the summer school begins, you should make some preparations; mostly that means
installing a bunch of software on your recommend.

We urge you to do this *before* we start, but if you have trouble with any of it,
then note that Monday morning is set aside for helping each other preparing everything.

- Install either Firefox or a Chrome-derived **browser** for optimal compatibility with tools we use
- [Join the Oscar **slack**](https://oscar-system.org/slack)
  (a multi user chat system), familiarize yourself with it,
  and there join the `#summerschool` channel
- [Register a **GitHub** account](https://github.com/signup)
- Find a **terminal** emulator for your operating system and familiarize yourself with the basics (e.g. [the first three sections of this tutorial](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/))
- Windows users need to first [install **WSL** (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) 
- Install the Linux or macOS version of **Julia** (Windows users: the Windows version is not supported; use the Linux version via WSL)
- Install **Oscar** [via our install instruction]({{site.baseurl}}/install/)
- If you do *not* have a favorite programming editor with Julia syntax highlighting:
    - install [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com)
    - in it, install ["Live Share" plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare)
      ([click here for instructions on how to use Live Share](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/use/vscode))
    - also install the ["Julia" plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=julialang.language-julia)
- Install [tmate](https://tmate.io) and try it out

Optionally, also do this:
- [Register a **gather.town** account](https://gather.town/signin)
- [Sign into **HackMD**](https://hackmd.io/login), e.g. using your GitHub account
