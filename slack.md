[Slack](https://slack.com) is a non-public chat platform that we use for informal
discussions, questions, and so on. Whether you need help installing OSCAR, using it, or
writing new code for it, you can ask here. Anyone is welcome to join.
[Use this invite link](https://join.slack.com/t/oscar-system/shared_invite/zt-1i2mu14ef-EAo9EYOlBQ1zk3_RGbMUaA).
You can use it from a web browser, or via one of the many native clients for phones, tablets and computers.
