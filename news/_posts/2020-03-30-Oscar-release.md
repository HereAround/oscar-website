title: Oscar 0.2.0 released; now an official Julia package
author: Claus Fieker

Oscar is now registered as an official Julia package! This means that
starting with version 0.2.0, the `Oscar.jl` Julia package can be
installed as conveniently as any other Julia package.

It requires Julia 1.3.1 and a recent enough C++ compiler (for details,
please [refer to the install instructions]({{ site.baseurl }}/install/)).
Now start Julia and enter
```julia
using Pkg ; Pkg.add("Oscar")
```

From this point on, you can load Oscar from any Julia session
by entering `using Oscar`:

```console?lang=julia
julia> using Oscar
