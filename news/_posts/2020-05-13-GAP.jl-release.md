been released.

[Diff since v0.3.5](https://github.com/oscar-system/GAP.jl/compare/v0.3.5...v0.4.0)


**Closed issues:**
- What are the rules for conversion when calling from GAP to Julia, and vice versa? And why are they this way? (#28)
- Strings which are not stringreps are not handled by `show` method and probably others (#176)
- Get GAP to use the same GMP as Julia, Nemo, ... (#254)
- Add ~/.julia/gap.sh back or revise OSCAR install instructions (#335)
- Installing GAP.jl simultaneously within multiple Julia versions may crash (#377)
- Implement support for passing keyword arguments to Julia from the GAP side (#381)
- JuliaExperimental depends (via zlattice.jl) on LinearAlgebra (#389)
- access to Julia variables from GAP (#390)
- Loading GAP.jl then Singular.jl causes ERROR: InitError: too many gmp (#392)
- Move GAP compilation to a separate GAPBuilder.jl, even if it compiles from source (#394)
- Update build.jl to guard for exceptions (#395)
- Track hash of GAP tarball, avoid extra downloads (#396)
- Acknowledge DFG funding in the package README & manual (#405)
- autom4te: cannot open configure: Permission denied (#406)
- Add constructors for conversion from GAP to Julia (#428)
- Don't call Pkg.build("GAP") (#435)
- Travis: figure out if caching Julia artifacts makes sense (i.e. provides a speedup), and how to do it safely (#437)
- How to get sublists of a GAP list? (#438)
- JuliaToGAP cannot convert Julia ranges to GAP lists (#439)
