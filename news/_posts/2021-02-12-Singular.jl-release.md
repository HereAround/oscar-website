Today [Singular.jl 0.4.5](https://github.com/oscar-system/Singular.jl/releases/tag/v0.4.5) has
been released.

[Diff since v0.4.4](https://github.com/oscar-system/Singular.jl/compare/v0.4.4...v0.4.5)

### Summary of changes
- Singular.jl should no longer crash on the new rings that Singular and its
libraries can create, or at least it should crash in far fewer cases. At a lower
level, this means that we have the internal function `create_ring_from_singular_ring`
for turning a `libSingular.ring_ptr` into a bona fide `Ring`.
- Singular's algebraic extensions of `QQ` and `Fp` can now be constructed via the
function `AlgebraicFieldExtension`. This function takes a univariate `FunctionField`
and a minimal polynomial in the function field to create the algebraic extension.
- Various small bugs have been fixed.

**Closed issues:**
- isnegative in src/number/n_Zp.jl calls isless, which is not defined (#50)
- Radical of an ideal (#101)
- Provide an up to date version of the documentation (#125)
- double definition (#308)
