title: GAP.jl 0.5.0 released
author: TagBot
---

Today [GAP.jl 0.5.0](https://github.com/oscar-system/GAP.jl/releases/tag/v0.5.0) has
been released.

[Diff since v0.4.4](https://github.com/oscar-system/GAP.jl/compare/v0.4.4...v0.5.0)

**Summary of changes**

From the user's viewpoint, this release mainly provides better support for Julia's constructors (compared to the function `gap_to_julia`),
and iteration for GP lists.
From a technical viewpoint, the most important changes are that now `GAP_jll` is used, and that GitHub Actions are used instead of Travis.

**Closed issues:**
- Naming conventions: JuliaGetGlobalVariable vs. JuliaFunction (#175)
- Add support for converting Julia Byte Array Literals / Base.CodeUnits to/from GAP strings (#177)
- Add possibility to add custom GAP packages (#246)
- GAP crash when loading `JuliaInterface` in a Jupyter notebook with GAP 4 kernel (#282)
- GAP's `-r` option and Julia's `.julia/config/startup.jl` (#284)
- Feature request: Use BinaryBuilder for GAP.jl (#285)
- Iteration protocol for GAP lists? (#345)
- problem with JuliaBindCFunction in JuliaInterface (#349)
- Optimization: reimplement C function `call_gap_func` in pure Julia (#360)
- Idea: better handling of compiled packages (#407)
- GAP.Packages.install now broken because of different build directory (#408)
- problem with `import` statements in files loaded via `JuliaIncludeFile` (#419)
- detect whether JuliaInterface (and GAP.jl) fit to a running GAP  (#433)
- installation problem for version 0.3.5 (#447)
- a change due to `GAP.prompt()` (#461)
- GAP.prompt() broken in ubuntu docker container (#465)
- Better EvalString error (#474)
- macros: bug or feature? (#517)
- ordering of initialization steps (#518)
- Error thrown by GAP: Error, DivideError: integer division error (#519)
- Fix convert(GapObj, big(2)^100) (#531)
- during build: LoadError: could not load library "libjulia" (#533)
- Regression through commit `fix conversion of strings containing null characters` (#545)
- Migrate from Travis to GitHub Actions (#552)
- Assertion on upcoming 1.6 when running tests (#560)
- Restore coverage reporting for GAP code (#571)
